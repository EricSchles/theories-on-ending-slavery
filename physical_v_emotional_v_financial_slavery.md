#The two types of slavery

There are really 3 types of slavery in this world - physical slavery, emotional slavery and financial slavery.  These 3 types of slavery refer
to the 3 types of control people exert over one another.

A great example of emotional slavery and the type of tactics most sex trafficked women experience is categorized by the show [UNReal](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3314218/).
I've never seen a more striking portrial of everything a sex trafficked individual is likely to experience.  Even the setting of the show -
the idea that there is one man and these women need to compete for the prize of the man's affection is close to how trafficked individuals
are manipulated.

It's terrifying how many of the details this show gets right.

The second type of slavery - physical slavery is when an individual is forced to work, or they are physically beaten.  They are alikely also
kept in chains and have physical constraints.  In this overt case, very little emotional or financial impunity is placed on the individual.
Instead physical bonds and redresses are used to keep the slave in check.  This was used primarily in slavery throughout history and it
is the context we are most familiar with.

The 3rd and final form is financial - this is by shackling individuals with debt in order to force them to continue working. Debt bondage is common
in many countries, usually 3rd world countries.

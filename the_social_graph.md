#The social graph

The idea for a set of data structures to understand and model power came to me from the implicit picture drawn in [this wonderful articile](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329850-600-end-of-nations-is-there-an-alternative-to-countries/?utm_source=NSNS&utm_medium=SOC&utm_campaign=hoot&cmpid=SOC%7CNSNS%7C2016-GLOBAL-hoot).  In case the article has been removed, taken down or the link has simply disappeared, I have copied it's contents [here](End_of_nations_Is_there_an_alternative_to_countries.txt).  You're far better off reading from the link than my copied version, it only has the text.

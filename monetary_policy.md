#Monetary policy

There are some ideas that I'm lifting directly from here when I talk about monetary policy:

It seems clear to me that monetary policy is important and only through less subtle means of monetary policy - instead of moving through financial markets.  Moving directly through monetary mechanisms to the real economy can we create substantial social change.

Why should we care about the economy when thinking about ending slavery?

Slavery is a perversion of markets.  If we are interested in removing it from the world, we need to create a economy where resources are
distributed equitably.  Therefore is the economy is performing optimally, there will be a decrease in slavery, because more people have
the ability to take care of themselves and do not end up in the situation of becoming slaves, by any measure.  There are a few mechanisms
by which slavery occurs that are directly related to economic station:

1. Sex trafficking
2. debt bondage
3. labor trafficking
4. Organ trafficking

Sex trafficking is more or less a special case of labor trafficking - you don't have the ability to do anything else to earn money and
your wages are held from you because you don't have enough current ability to exercise the means to obtain payment for the services you
render.  The reason sex trafficking is considered a seperate category is because of the psychological and physiological effects on the 
victims.  Labor trafficking does not necessarily imply you will be raped or beaten - sex trafficking usually does.

However, the most important part of all four the above listed types of slavery, is they would not occur to people with an equitable or fair
amount of financial resources.  Because such individuals would be able to make use of the court system, should they ever enter such a
situation, making it far far too costly for the slaver owners to continue such a practice.  Or the would be victims of such a practice would
never enter such a state to begin with.

Therefore we can encapsulate some of the conditions of entering slavery through the lense of economic distribution being inherently unfair.
Should a more equitable distribution arise, therefore, naturally slavery of the above mentioned types should fall.  Therefore a discussion
of economic stimulation to the economy, such that money moves from a few hands to many hands is both important and necessary to discuss
solutions to the problem of slavery.
